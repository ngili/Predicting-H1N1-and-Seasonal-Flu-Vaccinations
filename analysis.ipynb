    "The datasets used for this project were downloaded from [Driven Data](\"https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/66/flu-shot-learning/page/210/). The original data source is the [National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey (NHFS)](https://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20140511165905/http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nis/data_files_h1n1.htm) and it contains information on the social,economic and demographic backgrounds of the respondents as well as their opinions on the H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccines. The datasets have been divided into the training set features, the training set labels and the test set features. The training data has 26707 rows and 36 columns. The information contained with the columns is as follows as described by the data [dictionary](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/66/flu-shot-learning/page/211/):\n",
